1. Not consistent error behavior between get and put/post methods. Get always return 200, while put/post return 400 on error behavior

2. Behavior of editting questions not clearly defined. (find TODO in tests/test_backend.py)

3. Finish test_QuestionEdittingApi

5. Make a note about the return values - { res: ... } vs. { error: ... }

6. Make a note about how tests work

7. When sending question info to students, we should omit whether a choice is correct or not for active questions

8. Do we need an api to get Round details?

9. Questions api is inconsistent - it allows questionIds as parameters. Needs a QuestionDetails api instead

10. We should put the object descriptors passed to myJson in some more central place
